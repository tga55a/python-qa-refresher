This project is a Python refresher focused on QA skills: reading code, identifying defects, writing tests, and debugging failures.

All work must be completed in **GitHub Codespaces**.

1. Click **Code → Codespaces → Create codespace on main**
2. Wait for the environment to finish building
3. Do all work inside Codespaces

## Running Tests

From the terminal in GitHub Codespaces, run:

```pytest```


**All** tests must pass **before** submission.
